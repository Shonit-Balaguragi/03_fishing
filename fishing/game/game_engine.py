"""
GameEngine: owns the hook and the fish, and runs one frame's worth of
game logic.

Starter version: the hook casts and retracts automatically in a
continuous loop - there's no player control over casting yet (that's
Task 3), only one fish type exists (Task 2 adds more), and there's no
round timer (Task 4). Catch detection also has a known bug (see
game/catch.py) that Task 1 asks you to fix.
